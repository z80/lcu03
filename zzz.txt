1) Changed capacitor to 2.4nF to decncrease switching frequency from 300kHz to 150kHz. Otherwise MOSFET couldn't 
close fast enough.
2) Changed 1k to 5k ressitpr which tights switching signal to ground. It increased upper voltage. So mosfet can 
open now. Otherwise it couldn't open and stayed closed. (Or in saturation???)
3) Hall sensor wires are flipped. Actually 1-st is 2-d and vise versa. Just change names in the firmware....

4) Step up converted doesn't work with values cqlculated as well. Changed it in the following way.
    a) Upper 470->0, capacitor is not needed. And left 1k pull down as in original scheme.
    b) 1.2nF->2.4nF to reduce frequency to 150kHz. Otherwise MOSFET heats up.
